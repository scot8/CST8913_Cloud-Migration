# GCP Cost Optimization Strategy

This document outlines recommendations for optimizing costs across various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, focusing on compute, storage, databases, networking, and security.

## 1. Optimize Compute Instances

### Sustained and Committed Use Discounts:
- **Sustained Use Discounts** automatically reduce costs for VM instances running continuously each month. For workloads with consistent usage, ensure these instances remain active for most of the month to maximize this discount.
- **Committed Use Contracts** offer additional savings (up to 57%) on compute resources in exchange for a 1- or 3-year commitment. For predictable workloads (e.g., primary compute and high-security instances), consider committing to these contracts for significant savings.

### Right-Sizing VM Instances:
- **Analyze Usage Patterns** using Cloud Monitoring to determine if certain instances (especially `n2-standard-2` and `e2-micro` instances) are underutilized.
- **Downsize or Switch to Smaller Instance Types** (e.g., from `n2-standard-2` to `n1-standard-1` or using lower CPU configurations) where applicable, particularly for instances supporting low-intensity background tasks.

### Use Preemptible VMs for Non-Critical Tasks:
- **Preemptible VMs** are cost-effective for workloads that can tolerate interruptions, as they offer up to 80% savings on regular VM costs.
- Deploy preemptible VMs for batch processing, analytics preparation tasks, or non-critical background jobs.

## 2. Optimize GPU Usage

### Evaluate GPU Requirements:
- Given the high cost of GPU instances, consider if the `a2-highgpu-1g` instance is over-provisioned for certain tasks. **Downscaling to an instance with fewer GPU resources** or moving specific workloads to TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) could yield cost savings, especially for machine learning tasks.

### Schedule GPU Instances:
- Set up **scheduled shutdowns during off-peak hours** when GPU processing is not needed, saving costs by avoiding unnecessary instance uptime.

## 3. Optimize BigQuery Costs

### Slot Reservations and Autoscaling Adjustments:
- **Consider purchasing reserved slots** based on historical usage patterns if autoscale slots are consistently underutilized. For heavy, predictable workloads, reserved slots can reduce the total cost.
- **Lower autoscaling maximum slot capacity** if peak usage is less than anticipated, which can lower the autoscale bill.

### Optimize Storage:
- **Partition and Cluster Tables**: Partitioning and clustering can reduce scan costs by limiting the amount of data queried. For example, partition tables by time and cluster by frequently queried fields.
- **Use Long-Term Storage Discounts**: BigQuery applies lower costs for data stored over 90 days. Move less-accessed data to long-term storage to benefit from these discounts.

## 4. Optimize Database Costs (Cloud SQL and Bigtable)

### Scale Database Instances Based on Demand:
- **Cloud SQL (MySQL)**: Use Cloud SQL Autoscaler to dynamically adjust the instance size based on current demand, avoiding over-provisioning during off-peak hours.
- **Bigtable Node Adjustments**: Monitor usage and adjust the number of nodes based on actual demand. Bigtable allows for horizontal scaling, so consider reducing node count during low-demand periods to lower costs.

### Evaluate Storage Options for MySQL:
- **Move seldom-accessed data to Coldline or Archive Storage** in Cloud Storage, which is more cost-effective for archiving purposes.
- **Regularly archive old transaction data** that is no longer needed for real-time access, helping reduce MySQL storage costs.

## 5. Optimize Networking and Content Delivery

### Optimize Load Balancer Configurations:
- **Reduce Forwarding Rules**: Minimize the number of forwarding rules for Cloud Load Balancing, as each rule incurs costs. Consolidate rules wherever possible.
- **Regional Load Balancers**: If traffic is predominantly in specific regions, switch from global to regional load balancers to reduce costs, as regional balancers are generally more cost-effective.

### Leverage Cloud CDN Efficiently:
- **Cache More Static Assets**: Ensure that static content, like images, JavaScript files, and CSS, is cached to reduce repeated requests to backend servers, saving on compute and networking costs.
- **Enable Cache Policies for API Calls**: For API-driven applications, set longer cache expiration times for endpoints that return static or infrequently updated data.

## 6. Optimize Storage Costs

### Use Lifecycle Policies in Cloud Storage:
- **Implement Lifecycle Management** to automatically transition data from Standard to Nearline, Coldline, or Archive storage as it becomes infrequently accessed. This reduces storage costs for archived or less frequently used data.
  - **Example**: Set a policy to move data older than 30 days to Coldline storage and older than 365 days to Archive storage.

### Right-Sizing Storage Classes:
- For data that doesnâ€™t require immediate access, consider **Coldline or Archive storage** rather than Standard storage. Archive storage offers substantial savings for long-term data that rarely needs retrieval.

## 7. Optimize Security Costs (Cloud KMS)

### Limit Key Use Operations:
- Review encryption key access frequencies and **reduce unnecessary key operations**. Cloud KMS incurs small costs for every operation, so limiting repeated access can help control these costs.

### Consolidate Keys Where Possible:
- If multiple datasets or services use individual keys, consider **consolidating to fewer keys** when feasible to reduce key management costs.

## Summary of Cost Optimization Recommendations

- **Compute and GPU**: Use sustained/committed discounts, preemptible VMs, and schedule shutdowns.
- **BigQuery**: Use reserved slots, partition/cluster data, and leverage long-term storage.
- **Databases**: Autoscale based on demand, archive old data, and adjust Bigtable nodes as needed.
- **Networking**: Minimize forwarding rules, use regional load balancers, and cache static content in CDN.
- **Storage**: Use lifecycle policies to shift data to cheaper storage classes and right-size storage options.
- **Security**: Limit Cloud KMS key operations and consolidate keys where possible.
